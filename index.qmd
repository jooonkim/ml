My collection of ML notes & musings as I [learn in public](https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public).

Separate sections for [concepts](https://jooonkim.github.io/ml/posts/concepts/), [math](https://jooonkim.github.io/ml/posts/math/), [projects](https://jooonkim.github.io/ml/posts/projects/), and [readings](https://jooonkim.github.io/ml/posts/readings/) are a work in progress.
