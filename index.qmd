Hello, World! This is my collection of ML notes & musings as I [learn in public](https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public). 

You can find the GitHub repository [here](https://github.com/jooonkim/ml).

All I have thus far are daily notes. Later, I hope to have separate sections for concepts, math, projects, and readings.
