Welcome! This is my repository of ML notes as I [learn in public](https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public). 

Partially a source to help others, partially a tool to measure progress, and partially a method of keeping myself accountable.

**Tip:** You can use the navbar to access my daily notes, concepts, math, projects, or readings.
